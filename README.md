## Project Overview

**Business Insights 360** is a comprehensive Power BI project designed for AtliQ Hardware, a global hardware manufacturing company. The project aims to provide actionable insights to help the company overcome its performance challenges in Latin America and make data-driven decisions.

## Problem Statement

AtliQ Hardware sells goods to major customers such as Croma, Best Buy, Staples, and Flipkart. These customers distribute products through online (E-commerce) and offline (Brick and Mortar) stores. Despite their substantial global growth, AtliQ Hardware has faced significant losses in Latin America due to inaccurate insights derived from outdated surveys.

The company previously relied on Excel for all analytical operations, which is no longer sufficient given their scale. To address this, AtliQ sought the expertise of a data analytics team to create a Power BI report that offers meaningful insights from their data.
